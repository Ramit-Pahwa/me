    "`1. What do you want to have completed by the end of the program?`\n",

    "By the end of the program, I want to add support for solving generalized eigenvalue problem efficiently and remove dependency on ARPACK.\n",

    "## Experience with Julia\n",

    "# The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem and Motivations\n",
    "The objective of the project is to add iterative methods for solving the (generalized) eigenvalue problem `Ax = λBx`.The goal of this project is to implement the Arnoldi or Lanczos method as a solver for the eigenvalue problem and to compare its performance with the ` eigs ` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many practical problems in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics are posed as eigenvalue problems, Hence, an efficient and quick solver for the problem is highly desirable. A typical source of large-scale eigenproblems is through a discrete form of a continuous problem. The resulting finite dimensional problems become large due to accuracy requirements and spatial dimensionality.To my understanding, a correct approach would be to write a separate package **IRAM.jl** dealing with the generalized eigenvalue problem through implementation of Arnoldi method which is typically suitable for computation of a small number of eigenvalues in cases where the matrix is large and sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Plan\n",
    "I propose to implement required functionality in a package IRAM.jl tacking the problem in parts.First looking at the problem ` Ax = λx `, then extending the implementation to the generalized eigenvalue problem  `Ax = λBx` \n",
    "I plan to implement a 5 step procedure to implement the solver for generalized eigenvalue problem and document my code as I progress as well as create a blog of the regular \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add efficient Implementation of Arnoldi factorization-base module.\n",
    "2. Add Implicitly restarted Arnoldi method using efficient implementation of shifted QR strategy.\n",
    "3. Handle specific target eigenvalues (such as largest/smallest real/imaginary part or maximum absolute magnitude) along with various stopping criterion and deflation, \n",
    "4. Locking and Purging of ritz value through Orthogonal Deflating Transformation\n",
    "5. Implementation of the solver for general problem `Ax = λBx` where ` B ` is symmetric positive definite (happens in FEM a lot) or potentially singular.\n",
    "**Implementation of Lancoz,block methods [post GSOC period]**\n",
    "\n",
    "I also aim to publish the work done during this period under the guidance of my mentor and continue to contribute and build the package beyond Summer of Code period."

In the context of the QR iteration, deflation amounts to setting a small subdiagonal element of the Hessenberg matrix $H$ to zero. This is called deflation because it splits the Hessenberg matrix into two smaller subproblems which may be independently refined further.\n",

However, it is usually the case that there are converged Ritz values appearing in the spectrum of $H$ long before small subdiagonal elements appear. This convergence is usually detected through observation of a small last component in an eigenvector $y$ of $H$. When this happens, we are able to construct an orthogonal similarity transformation of $H$ that will give an equivalent Arnoldi factorization with a slightly perturbed $H$ that does indeed have a zero subdiagonal, and this is the basis of our deflation schemes.\n",

    "**Goal:** *Implement Orthogonal Deflating Transformation+Documentation*\n",
    "\n",
    "During these 2 weeks, I implement a new function which would add Orthogonal Deflating Transformation functionality for IRAM.jl package, as well document and clean up my code base for the package.\n",

    "### Week 8\n",
    "**Goal:** *Add Locking and Purging functionality for Ritz Pair*\n",

    "During these two weeks, I plan to implement Shift and Invert Spectral Transformation Mode to solve the general eigenvalue problem, a great C++ implementation for reference is [Spectra](https://spectralib.org/) which mimics the ARPACK routines, I have already started with experimenting with [code](https://github.com/yixuan/spectra), plan to implement on similar lines.\n",

    "**Note 1**: I have no major plans for summer. I will try my best to learn as much as I can, during the project. My summer vacation starts on 30th April. Hence, I will start coding a 2 weeks earlier than the GSoC coding period, effectively giving me **14 weeks** to complete the project. Though my classes start in mid-July, it won't be an issue as I won't have any tests or examination until the end of August.\n"
